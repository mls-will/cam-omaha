But many of our clients have also been recognized with awards for achievements in membership, community service, and public relations — among other measures.",

Shortly thereafter, I was elected President of the organization.\nI consider myself fortunate to have worked with Joe over the last two years. Joe’s ability to organize and assist an organization made my job easy! Our meetings improved due to better planning and organization, and our intra-association communications improved immeasurably. Now that my term has expired, I feel like our association and its members have benefited from our relationship with CAM, and I leave office with a job well done, thanks mostly to Joe and his organization.",

He knows the ins and outs of all aspects of what needs to be done to run a successful organization, from finance to printing name tags.\nQuite honestly, I don’t think our Board and group as a whole would be as successful as it is today without Joe. He brings fresh ideas to the Board, such as the new banner to display at meetings to the most recent addition of the time- and money-saving new website for our group.
